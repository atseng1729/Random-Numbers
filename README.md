# Random Numbers

This repository uses the random.org API (https://www.random.org/clients/http/) to generate random numbers to create 128 by 128 RGB image and RSA key pair.

## Random.org

RANDOM.ORG offers true random numbers to anyone on the Internet. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs. People use RANDOM.ORG for holding drawings, lotteries and sweepstakes, to drive online games, for scientific applications and for art and music. The service has existed since 1998 and was built by Dr Mads Haahr of the School of Computer Science and Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin in Ireland. Today, RANDOM.ORG is operated by Randomness and Integrity Services Ltd.

### rsa.py

This file generates a simple rsa key pair using the following algorithm:

Note: The primes used here are between 10^3 and 10^9.

1. Two primes between 10^3 and 10^9 are randomnly generated using random.org
2. Modulus: The modulus is obtained by multiplying the two prime numbers. 
3. Totient: The totient is calculated by taking the product of one less of each prime.
4. Public key: The public key is generated by finding a random number, between 10^3 and 10^9 that is relatively prime to the totient.
5. Private key: The private key is determined by the modular inverse of the public key and the totient.

### rgb.py

This file generates a 128 by 128 rgb image of random pixels.
